# QWM-portfolio-optimization
==================================

Name of the project: QWM-portfolio optimization based on network analysis and clustering 

Team name: NYUQuantsGo

About project (pending): 
While there are many challenges in a portfolio optimization process relying on the corelation (or covariance) matrix, some of the most important issues (including potential lack of robustness and diversi cation) are due to the fact that correlation matrices lack the notion of hierarchy.
It was shown that many complex systems can be arranged in a natural hierarchy comprising nested substructures, and  nancial markets are no exception. While a correlation matrix makes no di erentiation between assets, some assets seem closer substitutes of one another, while others seem complementary to one another. This can be better handled through network analysis and clustering.
Network-based and clustering-based portfolio optimization is likely to deliver more robust and diversi ed portfo- lios, and achieve better risk-adjusted performances compared to portfolios obtained using commonly used portfolio optimization techniques. Since no single clustering algorithm can be said to perform best on all datasets, di erent strategies must be tested and compared.
